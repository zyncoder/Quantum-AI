### Grover's Algorithm: Theory and Python Example

#### Theory of Grover's Algorithm

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed by Lov Grover in 1996 for searching an unsorted database with N entries. It offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms, making it significantly faster for certain search problems.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Quantum Superposition**: 
   - Unlike classical bits, which can only be in states of 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.
   - Grover's algorithm uses superposition to simultaneously evaluate multiple elements in the search space.

2. **Oracle Function**:
   - The oracle function marks the solution(s) to the search problem within the quantum state.
   - It flips the phase of the solution(s), distinguishing them from non-solutions.
   - In Grover's algorithm, this oracle function is implemented as a quantum gate.

3. **Amplitude Amplification**:
   - Grover's algorithm iteratively applies the oracle and a reflection operator about the mean of the amplitudes to amplify the probability amplitude of the correct solution(s).
   - This process increases the probability of measuring the correct solution(s) while reducing the probability of measuring incorrect solutions.

#### Python Example of Grover's Algorithm

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Function to implement Grover's algorithm
def grover_algorithm(oracle, n):
    # Initialize quantum circuit with n qubits and n classical bits
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n, n)
    
    # Apply Hadamard gate to all qubits
    qc.h(range(n))
    
    # Number of iterations (approximately pi/4 * sqrt(N))
    num_iterations = int(np.pi / 4 * np.sqrt(2**n))
    
    # Apply Grover's iterations
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        qc.append(oracle, range(n))  # Apply the oracle
        qc.h(range(n))
        qc.append(diffusion_operator(n), range(n))  # Apply the diffusion operator
    
    # Measure all qubits
    qc.measure(range(n), range(n))
    
    return qc

# Function to create the diffusion operator
def diffusion_operator(n):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n)
    
    # Apply Hadamard gate to all qubits
    qc.h(range(n))
    
    # Apply X gate to all qubits
    qc.x(range(n))
    
    # Apply H gate to first qubit
    qc.h(n-1)
    
    # Apply controlled Z gate
    qc.cz(0, n-1)
    
    # Apply H gate to first qubit
    qc.h(n-1)
    
    # Apply X gate to all qubits
    qc.x(range(n))
    
    # Apply H gate to all qubits
    qc.h(range(n))
    
    # Convert to a gate
    diffusion_operator = qc.to_gate()
    diffusion_operator.name = "Diffusion Operator"
    
    return diffusion_operator

# Example usage: Grover's algorithm to search for a marked item in a 3-qubit system
n = 3  # Number of qubits
oracle = QuantumCircuit(n)
oracle.cz(0, 2)  # Oracle marking the state |101>

grover_circuit = grover_algorithm(oracle, n)

# Simulate the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(grover_circuit, simulator, shots=1024).result()

# Plot the results
counts = result.get_counts(grover_circuit)
print("Measurement outcomes:", counts)
plot_histogram(counts)
```

#### Explanation:

- **Quantum Circuit Setup**:
  - Initialize a quantum circuit with `n` qubits.
  - Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits to create an equal superposition of all possible states.

- **Oracle Function**:
  - The `oracle` function in the example implements a Controlled-Z gate (`cz(0, 2)`), marking the state `|101>` as the solution.

- **Grover's Iterations**:
  - The algorithm iterates `num_iterations` times, applying the oracle and a diffusion operator.
  - The diffusion operator reflects the amplitudes about the mean, amplifying the probability of the marked solution(s).

- **Measurement**:
  - Measure all qubits at the end of the circuit to collapse the quantum state into classical bits.
  - Simulate the circuit using a quantum simulator (`qasm_simulator` in this case) to obtain measurement outcomes.

- **Result Visualization**:
  - Plot the histogram of measurement outcomes to visualize the probability distribution of measured states.

Grover's algorithm demonstrates the power of quantum computing in efficiently searching unsorted databases, showcasing quantum principles such as superposition and amplitude amplification to achieve computational speedups beyond classical capabilities.
